# pico_placa_predictor-stackbuilders-python
This repository contains a Pico y Placa predictor implemented in Python, developed as part of the Stack Builders coding exercise. The Pico y Placa predictor allows users to check if a car with a given license plate number is restricted from being on the road on a specific date and time based on the Pico y Placa rules.

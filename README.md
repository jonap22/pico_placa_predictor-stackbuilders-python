# Pico&Placa Predictor - Stack Builders
This repository contains a Pico & Placa predictor implemented in Python, 
developed as part of the Stack Builders coding exercise. 
The Pico & Placa predictor allows users to check if a car with a given license plate number is restricted from 
being on the road on a specific date and time based on the Pico & Placa rules.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/jonap22/pico_placa_predictor-stackbuilders-python.git`

2. Install the required dependencies (pytest):
`pip install -U pytest`

3. Verify the given rules in the Pico&Placa rules txt file (`/data/pico_placa_rules.txt`)

| Weekday | Last plate number digit |
|---------|-------------------------|
| 1:      | 1,2                     |
| 2:      | 3,4                     |
| 3:      | 5,6                     |
| 4:      | 7,8                     |
| 5:      | 9,0                     |

4. Review all the unit test:

## Instructions
Using the language you feel most proficient in, we'd like you to write a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs should be a license plate number (the whole number, not the last digit. e.g., PBX-1234), a date (as a String), and a time. Feel free to choose the date/time format you're comfortable with. The program should return whether or not that car can be on the road. You may use any input and output method you prefer. Although it is not required, we'd love to see the following in your code for extra points:
* Good object-oriented code, avoiding repetition and favoring a consistent organization. You should stick to your chosen language's semantics and be as consistent as possible. 
* Correct usage of version control tools, with a good commit history and incremental software delivery practices. 
* Automated testing with any framework or tool of your choice. 
* We value candidates that love clean, well-structured code and that can creatively solve problems. 
* A ReadMe is always helpful to guide us through your exercise.

Please submit the result to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository and send us the URL within 72 hours. Once we receive this information, we'll ask our technical team to review it, and we'll let you know about the next steps of the process. 
Note: To develop this application, you need to consider the past rules of the Pico&Placa. (Hours: 7:00 am - 9:30 am / 4:00 pm - 7:30 pm). Additional research would be needed to complete the exercise.
